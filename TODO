- add to github
- separate scenes to files
- make all global params configurable by each scene
- add rotation sdf
- make stars co-planar
- add post-processing lens effects (e.g. bloom) with convolution
- add bounding approximations to SDFs

- make the color of difference sdf the color of the removed object at the intersection points


- simulate moving scenes (and consider lorentz transformations)
- simulate scattering
