- Optimize sphere SDF with approximation removing the sqrt when possible
- templatize SDFs (instead of using slow virutal functions)
- optimize convolution with FFT
- use palette for perlin colorizer
- add progress bar for post processing
- add rotation sdf
- profile and optimize
- give scenes names
- if my short-circuit optimization even helping? (evaluating less SDFs but marching lower distances)

- make the color of difference sdf the color of the removed object at the intersection points


- simulate moving scenes (and consider lorentz transformations)
- simulate scattering
