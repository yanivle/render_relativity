- make stars co-planar
- add post-processing lens effects (e.g. bloom) with convolution
- add rotation sdf
- profile and optimize
- give scenes names
- if my short-circuit optimization even helping? (evaluating less SDFs but marching lower distances)

- make the color of difference sdf the color of the removed object at the intersection points


- simulate moving scenes (and consider lorentz transformations)
- simulate scattering
